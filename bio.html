      <p>I am currently in the eleventh grade at Western Technical Commercial school in the specialized robotics program. 
		 I regularly participate in First Robotics and other related activities such as First Lego League. My hobbies 
		 include swimming, rock climbing, writing, and, of course, programming. I currently work as a programming teacher for younger students, and I have done part time work as a web developer. 
	     I am a very fast learner, a good problem solver, and I love to work with others. </p>

	 <p>My current skill set includes:  C# and .NET, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, R, and a bit of C++ and Ruby.</p>
